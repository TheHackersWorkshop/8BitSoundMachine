# 8BitSoundMachine

This project is an 8-bit sound machine that is based on two 555 timers resistors, buttons and a potentiometers. The sound machine can be used to create a variety of sounds, including square waves, sawtooth waves, and triangle waves sounds. The frequency and amplitude of the sounds can be adjusted using potentiometers.

Concept
The concept behind this project is inspired by old 8-bit gaming systems such as Atari and Commodore and Apple IIs. The sound machine uses tactile buttons connected to various resistor value resistors as the notes. And one potentiometers to vary the pitch and tone of the notes.
